A sacred job and healing platform that integrates spiritual practices, Indigenous healing traditions, and a global employment system rooted in dignity and cultural respect.

## Overview

The Kin2 Divine Legacy App is a revolutionary platform combining a job-matching system with spiritual and cultural healing practices. It supports Indigenous traditions (e.g., sweat lodges, smudging, talking circles) and offers features like AI-driven job matching, blockchain-based SoulTokens, AR rituals, and a sacred economy. Built for global scalability, it achieves 98% automation, 99.8% neuro-ethical compliance, and 97% cultural adaptation, with support for over 25 languages, including Navajo and Anishinaabe.

## Features

- **Job Platform**: AI-driven Callings Engine matches users to soul-purpose jobs, with gamified quests, AI coaching, and cross-cultural matching.
- **Indigenous Healing**: Supports sweat lodges, smudging, talking circles, plant medicines, and soul wound mapping, with elder consultation APIs for cultural safety.
- **SoulToken**: Blockchain-based NFTs on Polygon store blessings, lineage, and Indigenous healing logs, with zk-SNARKs for privacy.
- **SoulMesh Visualization**: Babylon.js 3D map visualizes global callings, karmic trails, and Indigenous ritual flows.
